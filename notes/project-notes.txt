    - Ongoing analytics preview
      ? Pie chart of activities
        - Toggle to show paused time with other activities (default: off)
      ? Timeline of session blocks
    - Pause/Resume


+ {manage/sessions}
  - Index page of sessions
    - live/closed
    - start/end timestamps (maybe just start timestamp and session length? How then to address 'paused' time?)

+ {manage/sessions/:id}
  - Basically an analytics preview
    - timeline
    - piechart of activities
  - update/delete buttons

+ {manage/sessions/create:id}
  - For after the fact data entry. Same or very similar to update view
  - start date/time
  - build-able list of activity -> duration items (these will get translated into session blocks)

+ {manage/sessions/update:id}
  - see create route

+ {manage/sessions/delete:id}
  - confirmation / warning

+ {/analytics}
  - A page with all the different analytics
    - Line graph where you can select: 
      - Date range or all recorded sessions
      - Each activity to be toggled on or off
        - These influence the calculated values. The totals are the sum of the selected activities. This way by selecting just one activity you can get specific info on that activity. Same for any combination.
      - Calculated values (text off to the side?)
        - Average total hours 
        - Average total hours (date range)
      - Toggle show hours per session/day/week/month/year
        - this is what the x axis becomes


    - Pie Chart showing time and percentage of time spent in different activities
      - Attached to same date span as line graph

    - Stats
      - Attached to same date span as line graph
      - Session count
      - Total hours spent
        - Total and broken down into activities
      - Average session length (not including 'paused' time)

pu@
- add some configuration to log me in by default in dev env.
- add any number of blocks to the session
  - IDEA: Have a seperate field that just lists the block numbers, then use that to get the values from the post body.


TODO:
- refactor middleware to use the determine auth middleware
- dash needs to be renamed? More of a landing page for people to tell them what the app is about before we demand authentication
- Install FF for testing (particularly the date/time inputs)
