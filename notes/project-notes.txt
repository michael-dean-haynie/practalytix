SITE MAP
+ {/}
  - Links
    - Start new session / resume session
    - Manage session

+ {/live} ({/live-session}?)
  - Live page features
    - Ongoing stopwatch for current session
    - Ongoing analytics preview
      ? Pie chart of activities
        - Toggle to show paused time with other activities (default: off)
      ? Timeline of session blocks
    - Pause/Resume


+ {manage/sessions}
  - Index page of sessions
    - live/closed
    - start/end timestamps (maybe just start timestamp and session length? How then to address 'paused' time?)

+ {manage/sessions/:id}
  - Basically an analytics preview
    - timeline
    - piechart of activities
  - update/delete buttons

+ {manage/sessions/create:id}
  - For after the fact data entry. Same or very similar to update view
  - start date/time
  - build-able list of activity -> duration items (these will get translated into session blocks)

+ {manage/sessions/update:id}
  - see create route

+ {manage/sessions/delete:id}
  - confirmation / warning

+ {/analytics}
  - A page with all the different analytics
    - Line graph where you can select: 
      - Date range or all recorded sessions
      - Each activity to be toggled on or off
        - These influence the calculated values. The totals are the sum of the selected activities. This way by selecting just one activity you can get specific info on that activity. Same for any combination.
      - Calculated values (text off to the side?)
        - Average total hours 
        - Average total hours (date range)
      - Toggle show hours per session/day/week/month/year
        - this is what the x axis becomes


    - Pie Chart showing time and percentage of time spent in different activities
      - Attached to same date span as line graph

    - Stats
      - Attached to same date span as line graph
      - Session count
      - Total hours spent
        - Total and broken down into activities
      - Average session length (not including 'paused' time)

    - Method Books
    - Focused Repertoire
  - Name
  - Description



- what would it take to make this subject agnostic? (don't sweat this!)
  - session types (practicing starcraft vs practicing piano / trumpet / music in general)
  - session blocks map to specific session types
  - both have to be database driven (customizable not just enumed.)
    - this causes problems like what if you delete a block type? Does that delete all those blocks? Just deactivate it? 2 blocks that are labeled similarly may confuse things especially if they can get activated/deactivated.


TODO:
- better user data for screenshots and test accounts.
- ?.csv tool for spreadsheets. ex date session activity
  - probably not going to do.
- Revisit style rules for beter mobile experience.

QA
  - [Implemented] Needs Tab titles
  - Needs Favicon
  - [FIXED] Users seem to be getting loged out? Maybe the expiration is way too low? Should be about 24 hours?
    - May be because of having 2 different prod tabs open at once?
    - Expiration was 2 minutes. updated to 24 hours
  - dash
    - [Implemented] rename to about
    - needs real content
  - signup
    - [CAN'T REPRODUCE]initial sign in redirects to about page. Should be sessions/
  - signin
    - email is case sensitive (problem?)

  - live recording
    - [Implemented] panel headings should be bold

  - session details
    - [Implemented] panel headings should be bold

  - edit session
    - [Implemented] panel heading should be bold

  - [NOT FIXING]Account details should show utc offset with timezone
